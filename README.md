# Runge-Kutta-Order-4
This is a python program to solve initial-value Problems for ODEs using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

As an example, the solution of the following coupled ODE system is obtained in the given code-

* x' = 9y; x(0) = 3
* y' = -x; y(0) = 1

Lastly, the solution is shown in the attached plot.
